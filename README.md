# Self Task: Webpage Design Recreation
- Completed recreating the webpage design with my own implementation approach.
- Made several styling adjustments to better match my understanding of layout and structure rather than copying exactly.
- Built a testimonial carousel from scratch and learned practical pitfalls of relying solely on timers for animations (tab throttling, transition sync issues, etc.).
- Focused on maintaining clear visual hierarchy and cleaner component structure.
- Realized that designing independently first would have improved clarity, as some layout decisions only became obvious during implementation.
